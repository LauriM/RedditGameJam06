EnergyCollector

Your goal is to collect enough energy blobs with the green blocks so that you can move to the next area. Dont hit the red blocks, or you will lose the energy blob permanently.

Keys:
Arrows -> Change gravity and move balls
R      -> Reset level (If you lose too much balls)
F9     -> Skip level (cheating!)
